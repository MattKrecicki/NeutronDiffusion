Neutron Diffusion Solution for the One-Dimensional Steady State Equation.

To Do
======================================
 - Block submatrix solve of Ax = b --> prevent building A
 - Fix dictionary problem when the same material is used more than once in a problem
 - Create a graphing class (inheritance)
 - Time Dependency
 - All the PyTest functions

Reference
======================================
 - computational\_engineering.py: Reference code from Ryan G. McClarren's book "Computational Nuclear Engineering and Radiological Science Using Python".
 - diffusion.py: The main code currently used with C-function speed-up.
 - diffusion\_lambda.py: The original multi-group diffusion problem written in python.
